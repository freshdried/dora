###Goals
- The first goal of this project is __Prosthetization__
	- An attempt to harness a living space as a prosthetic, or a tool: _an extension of the user_
	- In other words, an attempt to make my life easier
	- Sensory, physical data is collected, (visualized,) and made available _to the user_

- The second goal of this project is __Intelligence__
	- An attempt to enable a room to act _for the user_
	- In other words, an attempt to make my life _even_ easier
	- Sensory, physical data is collected, processed, and acted upon _for the user_

###Todo:
 - __core__
	 - initialize devices in index.js
	 	- device types in motor and sensory...
	 - Better error handling
	 - abstract out terminal functions ( so I can either use web or linux terminal)
 - __core-client__
 	- make core-client browser aswell as nodejs
	- give Core-client some initialization parameters
 - __control-shell__
 	- make terminal a require? (that supports multiple input/output transports)
 - Document arduino code/circuitry
 - Move to Streams?
