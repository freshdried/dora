#living-space
Transforms a living space into "living" space (living as in "alive").


###Goals
- The first goal of this project is __Prosthetization__
	- An attempt to harness a living space as a prosthetic, or a tool: _an extension of the user_
	- In other words, an attempt to make my life easier
	- Sensory, physical data is collected, (visualized,) and made available _to the user_

- The second goal of this project is __Intelligence__
	- An attempt to enable a room to act _for the user_
	- In other words, an attempt to make my life _even_ easier
	- Sensory, physical data is collected, processed, and acted upon _for the user_

###Todo:
 - core
	 - initialize devices in index.js
	 	- device types in motor and sensory...
	 - Better error handling
	 - Use logger like Winston
 - core-client
	 - abstract out core-client from reflex.js (so I can also use it in control-panel);
